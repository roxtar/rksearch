Simples search is not that bad. 
O(1) > O(N) for large values of "1"
Can't store strings of length 3 billion within "string" type, because string.length is of type int32
Also trying to generate a string which is 2 billion characters long, leads to an OutOfMemoryException (#bigsurprise)
RK Search does well for multiple strings
Problems in initial implementation -- was taking 3 times the time as simple search
Cuase Math.Pow, string.Length calls, base was arbitrarily set to 19. Made custom power. Improvement. But still took time. Lookup tables.
RK search better for larger strings, but length is limited by int 64 precision
